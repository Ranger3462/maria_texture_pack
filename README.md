I didn't like most of the textures of the Maria Texture Pack, but the weapons and armor were pretty cool. I'm working on pulling in the custom textures for the objects like the herbs and such still, but that will just be additional functionality.

Installation Process:
1) Download the ZIP file located in the main branch, most updated version will have the highest version number.
2) Place the file in "C:\Users\[DESKTOP USER]\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\resourcepacks"
3) Open Minecraft and load into Maria
4) Hit Escape and select Options
5) Select Resource Packs
6) Select the texture pack that matches the name of the file you downloaded
7) Hit done

Minecraft will temporarily reload, then you should have the updated textures. I recommend verifying by checking one of the tiered weapons or custom armor to make sure the changes have applied.
